			MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III)is a coding format for digital audio. </br>
			Originally defined as the third audio format of the MPEG-1 standard, it was retained and further extended—defining </br>
			additional bit-rates and support for more audio channels—as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard. </br> 
			A third version, known as MPEG 2.5—extended to better support lower bit rates—is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard. </br>
			MP3 (or mp3) as a file format commonly designates files containing an elementary stream of MPEG-1 audio and video encoded data, </br>
			without other complexities of the MP3 standard.
